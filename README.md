# PyTorch Implementation of Light GCN Paper

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Light Graph Convolutional Network (Light GCN) paper. Light GCN is a graph neural network designed for collaborative filtering tasks, particularly in recommendation systems.

## Overview

The Light GCN paper, titled "LightGCN: Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network for Recommendation," proposes a simplified yet powerful graph convolutional network for collaborative filtering. This implementation aims to provide an accessible and easy-to-understand codebase for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Light GCN for their recommendation tasks.
